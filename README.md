# DumbHotEncoder
I'm just learning how to use python for ML and Data Science. I found the existing OneHotEncoding in sklearn very complicated. Hence I wrote an insanely dumb one-hot encoder - **DumbbHotEncoder**.  
This is in super early stages. Please let me know your comments on improving this, in case you use it.
